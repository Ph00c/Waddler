        <h3 id="middle">Happy 9 months babe! This took a lot longer than expected but if you’re reading this then I got it to you on time! It’s always sad I never get to see you in person for these and be a little cheese ball telling you how much I like you though :( . I’m starting to realize why people hate long distance so much, but smallest itttiest bittiest part of me can appreciate it . Now don’t wait in Florida with a knife when I get there or anything, but stay with me here. With how we’re constantly long distance, I can’t help but be grateful I’m with someone so sweet, caring, and understanding. Not a day goes by where I’m not thinking about how much I miss you and just how amazing you are. You’re my biggest inspiration for getting up in the morning for nothing more than to just be someone you’re proud to date.  Thank you for being in my life Emily, you changed it more than I could’ve imagined.</h3>
        <h3 id="bottom">I’ll see you soon! 
Phuc </h3>
